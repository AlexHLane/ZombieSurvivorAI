# DePaul AI class
# Original project created by Will Meyer
#
#
# In this project, I received a base code for the survivors animation, moveto, and death, along with the scene set up with enemies.
# My task was to successfully make it to the 8th wave with my four survivors. I was allowed to use any sort of behavior I deemed
# useful in order to survive. I made multiple behavior trees, one for movement so that I could include A* pathfinding, and for
# firing the guns. I also had to make decisions on how to purchase more ammo, surivors, and gates.
#
# Using A* pathfinding, I was able to move my survivors around the board through the closest nodes to get to spawned loot boxes. I 
# did not use any additional weights to gauge the path, however, it was a feature I wanted to implement.
